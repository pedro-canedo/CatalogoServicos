## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
python 3.10 > | Docker 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

start the server with docker-compose

```
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build

```

if you want to access the admin panel, you will need to create an admin account, for this just access the docker cli and run the following command.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Now you need to run a migration with the following command in your docker cli

```bash 
python manage.py migrate
```

Good, now restart your container with name webAppCatalogoServicos frist

```bash
docker restart webAppCatalogoServicos
```

Ok now the server is running on http://localhost:8000

<!-- End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
